# School_District_Analysis

**1. Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.**

The purpose of this district analysis is due to the fact that the schoolboard had notified our client, Maria, that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. The evidence shows dishonesty in the 9th grade, specifically in the grade sections of; reading and math. 

We have been asked to replace all the grades from Thomas High School with NaNs while avoiding changes to the rest, and ultimately repeat the analysis to see impact of such changes. 

**2. Results:**

**- How is the district summary affected?**

The school summary was affected slightly, as it can be seen from the screenshots provided below. There was a drastic change after it was recalculated with the adjustment of replacing the grades from Thomas High School.

*originally, the reading score for Thomas High School 9th Grade was 83.7, and for the math score it was 83.6, as it can be seen the scores were repalced with NaN per direction to do so*
