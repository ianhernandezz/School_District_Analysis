# School_District_Analysis

**1. Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.**

The purpose of this district analysis is due to the fact that the schoolboard had notified our client, Maria, that there is evidence of academic dishonesty. The evidence shows dishonesty in the 9th grade, specifically in the grade sections of; reading and math. 

We have been asked to replace all the grades from Thomas High School with NaNs while avoiding changes to the rest, and ultimately repeat the analysis to see impact of such changes. 

**2. Results:**

**- How is the district summary affected?**
As it can be seen from the images below, there is a slight difference between the orginal and the re-calcualted analysis.

*originally, the reading score for Thomas High School 9th Grade was 83.7, and for the math score it was 83.6, as it can be seen the scores were repalced with NaN per direction to do so*

3. **Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.**

One of the main changes that can be deduces right from the get go is the fact that Thomas High School took a hit on its ranking among the other school. Secondly, the overall passing percentage of Thomas High School also went down from its original value. The original scores of the school can no longer be seen or taken into account of any anaylsis. It can be determined that these two sectiions alone make a great impact on the standing of a school.
